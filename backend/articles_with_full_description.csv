UnitedHealthcare boss Brian Thompson, 50, was shot in the back as he made his way to a conference on Wednesday, in what police believe was a targeted attack. On Saturday, city mayor Eric Adams said the ""net is tightening"" around the gunman, who has so far evaded police despite an extensive search and the use of facial recognition technology. The FBI has offered a $50,000 (£39,000) reward for information leading to the suspect's arrest. The latest images of the man being sought are both taken from a vehicle. In one, he can be seen in the back of a taxi wearing a hooded sweatshirt and a disposable face covering. In the second, he is seen outside of the car, again wearing a facemask. The new appeal came as US media reported a backpack thought to belong to the suspect recovered near the scene contained a Tommy Hilfiger jacket and paper money from the board game Monopoly. NYPD Crime Stoppers Thompson, a 50-year-old father of two, was shot as he made his was to an investor conference in Midtown Manhattan where he had been scheduled to speak later that day. Police said the gunman first fled the scene on foot, before riding a bike towards Central Park. The motive for the killing is still being investigated. Authorities have confirmed the words ""deny"", ""defend"" and ""depose"" were written on the bullet casings found close to the victim's body - language which could be associated with critics of the US's private health insurance industry. On Friday, a person familiar with the matter told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that investigators believed the suspect was no longer in New York City and may have boarded a bus to the city of Atlanta in the state of Georgia.

This initiative, though facing challenges like the lack of safety equipment for field teams and the sheer number of stray animals, has shown promise in reducing nighttime collisions. In a bid to protect the stray cattle, Uttar Pradesh introduced a seemingly simple solution—fluorescent reflective strips placed around the necks and horns of the animals. These glowing strips, visible under vehicle headlights, are designed to prevent accidents in the darkness. Officials claim the initiative has been effective, though concrete data to support these claims is still pending, reported ToI. In Pilibhit, where the initiative first began, the task of turning stray cattle into beacons has proven both bold and challenging, with obstacles as formidable as the animals it aims to protect. On three key highways—Bareilly-Haridwar NH-74, Pilibhit-Basti NH-730, and Bhind-Lipulekh NH-731—teams of workers attached reflective tapes to 450 stray bulls. The project, costing Rs 400 per animal, was designed to increase visibility, especially for those with black coats that tend to blend into the night. The initiative’s success is largely attributed to the active support of local villagers. “It’s an ambitious project,” said Virendra Singh, the assistant regional transport officer leading the effort. Villagers not only backed the initiative but also funded much of its cost. However, the process was far from smooth. Field teams faced significant risks, as they lacked protective gear and tranquilization tools, leaving them vulnerable to potential attacks from the very animals they were attempting to protect.

""But without proper safety measures, we cannot extend the initiative further."" h strays. Today, that number has grown to an estimated 15 lakh, with 12 lakh reportedly housed in shelters. A private company working with the state has demonstrated reflective tapes in three sizes, ensuring they fit animals of varying proportions. The project has also opened the door to broader collaboration between the Animal Husbandry Department and the Transport Department, which are mapping accident-prone areas for further intervention. Additional transport commissioner Pushpsen Satyarthi told ToI, ""This is about making roads safer for both humans and animals, preventing unnecessary collisions, and saving lives."" For now, the reflective tapes glint in the headlights of passing vehicles-a flicker of hope against the vast darkness of UP's roads. Whether this light can spark systemic change remains an open question.
